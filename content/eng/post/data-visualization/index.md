# This Week Was Challenging

## Computer Architecture

I completed Laboratory Work No. 8 for the subject of Computer Architecture "Operating Systems." In it, I worked with files.

## Programming

I wrote code to create a search engine as part of my computer practical assignment.

**Bilibili**:

## Foreign Languages

With my group team, we presented on the topic "Modern Cities: Dystopia or Utopia?"

I started studying the last chapter of the C1 level German language textbook.

## History of Religions

I watched the film "Stalker," which I find very interesting and educational.
